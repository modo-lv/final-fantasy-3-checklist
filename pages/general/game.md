## [Jobs], stats and leveling

### Leveling
Characters level up by gaining *EXP*, while jobs are leveled up by performing *actions* (any except running away or changing formation) in combat. It takes between 5 and 10 actions (depending on the job and job level) to gain one job level (except for [Onion Knight]s, who need 13 actions after reaching level 14).

### Stats
All stats except [HP] (see below) are determined by your character level and job (but *not* job level). Each job has a predetermined stat values for each character level, so switching jobs will change the character's stats according to their level and what the new job is.

#### [HP]
[HP] is the only permanent stat that doesn't change when switching jobs. It's determined by the character's [Vitality] (+ some randomness) at the moment of leveling up. So if a character is is lagging behind in HP, assign them a high-[Vitality] job to catch them up (see [the relevant reference section](job_vitality) for details on job [Vitality]).

## [MogNet](@Mognet) {##~}

### Getting [Onion Knight] {##~}

This [job] is acquired by completing a side-quest that unlocks when you complete 25% of the [bestiary]. If you find and defeat all new enemies as soon as they become available, you will reach this point when you finish [Tower of Owen]. With [Luneth] as the head of the party, check the MogNet for letters from [Topapa]. You should have received four, last of which informs you of the quest.

### [Legendary Smith](@~) {##~}

Legendary Smith is the source of [Ultima Weapon] and job-specific [ultimate weapons](Ultimate_weapon_(term)#Final_Fantasy_III) for each job that reaches job level 99.

Once you have completed [Cave of Tides], check MogNet with [Ingus] as the head of the party to read the fourth letter from [Princess Sara](Sara_Altney). Visit her and then [Takka].

Once you complete the [Saronia] part of the main story, check the MogNet as [Luneth] or [Arc] to read the fourth letter from [Takka], which will cause the smith to appear in [Northwester Saronia](Northwest). Talk to her.

Once you acquire [Invincible], check MogNet as [Refia] to read the fifth letter from from [Takka], after which you'll also receive the fourth letter from [Cid]. Go to [Canaan], complete his quest and talk to him.

Once you complete the [Doga's Grotto], talk to the smith in [Falgabard]. After that she will continue to appear randomly in one of several places, see [the wiki](Legendary_Smith#The_smith.27s_locations) for details.
