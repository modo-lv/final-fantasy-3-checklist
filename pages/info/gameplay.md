## Miscellaneous

* [MP] can only be recovered by resting or at a [HP]/[MP] recovery point (or by using an [Elixir]).
* [Phoenix Down]s cannot be bought, they can only be found in chests or randomly acquired from enemies.
* Game can only be properly saved on the world map. Quicksaves are meant for when you have to exit the game â€” the command closes the game after saving and erases the quicksave when you continue.
* Shields protect against magic as well as physical damage.
* It is possible to do more than 9999 damage, but the display won't show it. The maximum damage you have done in the game can be seen along with other game stats in [Gysahl] or on the [Invincible].
* Most towns have a [revive](wellspring), commonly in a house with a blue roof.

## Stats and leveling {##gameplay_stats}

### Leveling
Characters level up by gaining *EXP*, while jobs are leveled up by performing *actions* (any except running away or changing formation) in combat. It takes between 5 and 10 actions (depending on the job and job level) to gain one job level (except for [Onion Knight]s, who need 13 actions after reaching level 14).

### Stats
All stats except [HP] (see below) are determined by your character level and job (but *not* job level). Each job has predetermined stat values for each character level, so switching jobs will change the character's stats according to their level and what the new job is.

#### [HP](@~) {##~}
[HP] is the only permanent stat that doesn't change when switching jobs. It's determined by the character's [Vitality] (+ some randomness) at the moment of leveling up. So, if a character is starting to lag behind others in HP, assigning them a high-[Vitality] job will let catch up with further level-ups (see [the relevant reference section](job_vitality) for details on job [Vitality]).
