Equipping throwing weapons allows you to attack from the back row without penalty.

THe damage formula is complicated, but a very rough approximation to give you some idea would be 1000 base damage + 60 for each attack point. This is a *very* rough average, the real amount will differ a lot (up to a thousand or two either way) depending on your job level and pure randomness.
