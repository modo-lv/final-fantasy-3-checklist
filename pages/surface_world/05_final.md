## [???](@) {#bonus}

Once unlocked, can be found underwater directly west of the very tip of the Dalg continent (where [Doga's Manor] is). See [the side-quest section](bonus_unlock) on how to unlock this dungeon.

`i` This is an exceedingly difficult area with the strongest enemies in the game, meant for grinding levels and [Onion Knight] equipment. You will need to level up a lot to stand a chance against the boss (fighting him at level 75 is a considered a low level challenge), and once you're strong enough to defeat him, the rest of the game (including the final boss) will pose very little challenge, if any.

##### Enemies
* [Yellow Dragon]
* [Green Dragon]
* [Red Dragon]
* `★` [Iron Giant]
