# Final Fantasy III checklist

## About this guide {##about}

This is a spoiler-free (as much as possible) checklist for [Final Fantasy III (Steam version)](https://store.steampowered.com/app/239120/FINAL_FANTASY_III/) to help you track progress and avoid missing anything. It's not a walkthrough or a strategy guide, although it does contain some instructions on getting things you could miss otherise. If you complete everything in this checklist, including the optional stuff, you will have collected every item in the game (100% treasure chest completion), encountered every enemy (100% bestiary completion) and completed every sidequest. This should also net you most of the [achievements](https://steamcommunity.com/stats/239120/achievements) with the exception of "Jack Of All Trades" (level up all jobs for all characters to 99).

A couple of notes:

* All checkboxes are for treasure chests unless otherwise indicated.
* `‚ú®` means an item that can be picked up by zooming in the camera and examining the shining spot, and `üí¨`{:label} means getting an item requires talking to someone. These items do not count towards the chest percentage and therefore don't affect the achievement.
* `‚öîÔ∏è` means an enemy (not used in explicitly titled enemy lists) that you need to defeat to add to the [bestiary], and `‚òÖ`{:label} marks a boss.
* Label `w`{:label} (short for "warning") is for important information about something that can have serious (usually permanent) consequences for your playthrough. Most often they're cases where you lose access to a location, item, enemy or something else, often permanently.
* Label `i`{:label} (short for "information") is for potentially helpful but not vital information, such as a shop selling a special item or when a quest becomes available at a certain location.
* Label `x`{:label} (short for "explanation" or "X marks the spot") is detailed information on where to find and how to access the item/character/location/etc.
